# Conditional Statements

Math is good, but what we need to be able to make decisions and do different things based on some conditions.  We need to be able to **do stuff** based on **what we know**.

If the temperature is below freezing, suggest a jacket.

If cost of your mocha latte is more than the cash in your pocket, order a water.

In programming we combine *comparison operators* with *conditional statements* like the `if` statement.  A simple `if` statement looks like this:

    if airTemp < 32 {
        print("NorthFace time Boulder!")
    }

But what about other temperatures?  If we have just two conditions, then `if / else` statements do the trick.

    if airTemp < 32 {
        print("NorthFace time Boulder!")
    } else {
        print("Shorts time!")
    }

Hmmmmm.  That doesn't seem quite right.  Maybe `if / elseif` is the way to go.


    if airTemp < 32 {
        print("NorthFace time Boulder!")
    } else if airTemp < 60 {
        print("Flannel time!")
    } else {
        print("Shorts time!")
    }

#### ! Not Operator
* You can "reverse" or "flip" a boolean expression with `!`
* `!true` is `false`

    var warningLightOn:Bool = true

    if !warningLightOn {
        // continue normal operation
    } else {
        print("Warning light is on")
    }


# Comparison Operators
The **comparisons** above are what makes this possible.  The comparisons are `airTemp < 32` and `airTemp < 60`.  Each returns `true` or `false` the two possible values of the **boolean** data type.

These are all the comparison operators and each returns a `Bool` value.

#### == Equals
* Are two expressions the same?
* 1 = 1

#### != Not Equals
* Are two expressions not the same?
* 1 != 2

#### < Less Than
* Is the first expression smaller than the second?
* 1 < 2

#### > Greater Than
* Is the first expression larger than the second?
* 2 > 1

#### <= Less Than or Equal To
* Is the first expression smaller or the same as the second?
* 1 <= 1

#### >= Greater Than or Equal To
* Is the first expression larger or the same as the second?
* 1 >= 1

### Remember
Each clause in an `if/else if` statement must evaluate to either `true` or `false`.

/*:
Note in the `doesLikeRed` case above we don't have to compare the variable to true.  The `== true` is implied.  
So looking farther back, you could write `if (airTemp < 32) == true` but that's just silly.

If you have a `Bool` value, it can also be used alone.

Also an `if` statement can be placed inside the clause of another statement.  We call this "nesting" if statements.


    if something == true {
        if someOtherThing == true {
            // I should end up here.
        } else {
            // not here
        }
    } else {
        // or here
    }

Be warry of too many nested if statements - they can make code very hard to read.

## Verbosity
> Apple ObjC and Swift developers are pretty "verbose" and write long function names with very descriptive argument names.

> Use specific, consistent names and namining conventions and

![Fix](Fix.png)
> Most of our earlier examples have been *syntax* errors.  With conditionals, we start seeing semantic errors appear.
