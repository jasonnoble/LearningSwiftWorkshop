# Comments and Errors

## Comments
- comments are text put into the source code ONLY for people to read
- all comments are ignored by the *compiler*
- this text you're reading right now, is really just a *fancy* comment!

**one-line** comments:
*/
// start with "double forward slash"
/*:
**many-line** comments
*/
/* 
  start with "forward slash star"
  end with "star forward slash"
 */
/*:
## Errors
- many errors are found by the compiler as you enter source code
- many other errors are found at runtime

Before we continue, let's talk about errors - they break stuff.  You need to fix the errors in your code so that the Playground runs correctly.

#### Comment out or delete any code above that may be *throwing an error*.

> Be double sure you don't have errors above (or leave any when you're done below)
>
> When you see `UNCOMMENT` then you should **delete the comments so that the code will run**.
>
> All the **fix** exercises work on this principle.  
> 1. Uncomment code
> 2. Change code to fix the errors and get it running
> 3. Observe output - just because it runs, is it right?
